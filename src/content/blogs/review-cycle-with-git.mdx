summary: "Have you ever wondered, what if one day Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab, etc. goes down? How does review cycle work then."

## The thought

It was a normal working day, I was about to review an important PR when Bitbucket went down.
It was the genesis moment for this thought:

> What happens to the PR review cycle in a non Github world?

## The answer

Hopefully, after a few minutes Bitbucket was up and running, but so was that thought. I did some
research + thinking and came to the following steps that one can follow if something urgent comes up!

### 1. Branch to be reviewed

Checkout to the branch you want to review, to keep it easy let's assume the
feature branch is named as `feature-branch`. Now from this branch do

```bash
git checkout -b review-branch
```

As the `review-branch` is based on `feature-branch` it will have everything that we need to review.

### 2. Get the diff

You all must be aware of git diff, it is used to compare two branches. Just do the following
with the branch you want to compare it with. The `base-branch` can be master/main or devel, depending
on your project structure.

```bash
git diff base-branch review-branch
```

The diffed output with git added/removed lines notation will be thrown on the terminal. Depending
on your terminal, it may or may not be user-friendly. Skim through the changes, and open the files
where you want to add the review comments, select a suitable line above the change and type something like

```bash
// Review-comment - Hey please change 1+1 = 3 to 1+1 = 2, thanks!
```

Add, commit and push the review changes in a fixed format with an identifier (for eg Review-comment) and handover
the branch to the reviewee.

### 3. Let it grep

The `git grep` is pretty interesting and powerful, and I hope you would have guessed its usage here.
Reviewee just has to grep the review comment identifier to get the list of all the review comments.

```bash
git grep 'Review-comment'
```

From here onwards, the changes can be pushed to the `review-branch`. Then we can merge the branch `review-branch` into the `feature-branch` and
get that merged further into the `base-branch`.

## Conclusion

There may exist numerous other ways to do the review cycle without git management systems.
This is just what I thought of as a possible solution. If you can think of other ways, do let me know!
Also, writing this blog made me realize how important these git management systems are.

> Thanks and happy reviewing!
