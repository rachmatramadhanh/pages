## Problem

Are you like me? who likes to lay the foundation and skeleton of the code they write and then mark areas to be done some time later? (Hydrate your code, :p).
I mark the areas effectively but on the fulfilling front, I miss out. If that's the case with you, let's find a way to make the processes easy.

## The CLI way

We as developers use git more than we drink water (A reminder, drink water!). If it's your personal project, then formalize a convention to mark
TODOs in your commments.

```bash
//TODO - This is an example TODO that I'll check later
//PIKACHU - Remind me to catch em all
//JARVIS - Remind me to refactor this bit
```

Your identifier can be anything, I personally use TODO, you'll know why in a bit.

Now to get the list of TODOs just do:

```bash
git grep 'TODO'
```

Boom, your terminal will show the list of your TODOs.
If you are lazy like me and don't want to do all that greppin, there's also a simple way but
it's editor specific.

## The GUI way

Extension in VS Code can really help us in being more productive. One of such is [TODO Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree).
You can get a much smoother experience, as it has various default identifiers, such as TODO, FIXME, NOTE, BUG, and more. There's a whole config that can be customized
to your needs, so `JARVIS` is possible.

You can add this simple config to your vs code settings:

```js
"todo-tree.highlights.customHighlight": {
   JARVIS: {
     foreground: "black",
     iconColour: "red",
     gutterIcon: true
   }
 }
```

This can even help cross-teams to use a common way to track in-code TODOs but do remember to
complete them!
