Hey there! I'am Rachmat, a self-taught developer fascinated by the prospect of using technology to aid in creating a fairer, more inclusive world.

I work to the principle that simple is beautiful, while carefully including the finest details and interactions. 
I'm quite confident, naturally curious, and perpetually improving my skillsðŸ’ª.

I studied Electrical Engineering at Politeknik Negeri Ujung Pandang, Indonesia from 2009 to 2012, and worked as a technician at the Hasanuddin University Teaching Hospital after graduating. My last position was as a shift team leader. While working there, I ran several small businesses and also learned how to create a website.

## What Iâ€™ve been up to

I've been recently focused on building React applications, diving deeper into React itself as well as libraries and tools surrounding it. 
I've also been learning lots too-like how to test my code effectively, optimizing performance and I've also started recently learning Typescript and already feeling the benefits of type safety and all the other great things it brings!
