I love building products using React + TypeScript and Python. To sum it up, I basically
make and break frontends.

I&apos;ll be honest with you, I needed an excuse to get my hands on Next JS, TypeScript
and styled-components, that&apos;s why I revamped this page and also due to my sudden
urge to write blogs :)

I love open-source ❤️ and have contributed to these projects.

- design-react-kit
- express-rate-limit
- Accord project

I like music a lot. My fav artists are The Weeknd, Linkin Park, Anup Jalota, and Eminem. These are taken from my spotify wrapped, yeah one for every mood!
Also notice the Spotify Icon in the footer? Yes it'll show my currently playing song.

Have any questions? feel free to drop me a message on Twitter.
