I love building products using React + TypeScript. To sum it up, I basically
make and break frontends. Apart from JS, I can code in python and C++ too.

Stuff I am currently dealing/learning:

- [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) & [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [three.js](https://threejs.org/)

I&apos;ll be honest with you, I needed an excuse to get my hands on Next JS, TypeScript
and styled-components, that&apos;s why I revamped this page and also due to my sudden
urge to write blogs :)

I love open-source ❤️ a lot and I maintain my GSoC project:

- [design-react-kit](https://github.com/italia/design-react-kit)

To view my contributions, you can head over to my Github.

I like music a lot. My fav artists are The Weeknd and Linkin Park.
Also notice the Spotify Icon in the footer? Yes it'll show my currently playing song.

Have any questions? feel free to drop me a message on Twitter.
